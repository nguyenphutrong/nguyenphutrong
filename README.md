# Hi, I'm Trong (Phú Trọng)

I'm a software engineer working across **developer tooling, system design, and long-term maintainability**.

My work focuses on:
- Designing tools that remove friction from developer workflows
- Making system behavior observable and predictable
- Building foundations that scale with real-world usage

I value clarity, constraints, and practical impact over complexity.

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

- Prefer **explicit systems** over implicit behavior  
- Optimize for **team clarity**, not individual cleverness  
- Make failure modes visible and recoverable  
- Good tooling should disappear into the workflow
